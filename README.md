The attached PowerBI project is a side project that I did to showcase historical data for a potential client around sales and customer data/metrics. This was a project to simulate a real life consulting opportunity where I was taking the raw historical data from a client and transforming it into a usable report where they can make informed decisions on their customers and sales organization.

I was responsible for doing showcasing two things to the client and then sending them a follow up response to spark a conversation on how we can help them.
  1. Please recreate the screenshotted legacy report from the Excel file.
  2. Impressing the client by designing an additional 1–2-page report demo highlighting your capabilities in terms of both data analysis and report design.

Below is the email that I sent to the client.



Hi _client_,

I wanted to reach out today and provide you all with the finalized version of your firm's Powerbi report. Within this report you will see three key things.

You will see that I have recreated your requested legacy report. This report, shown under the "Recreated Report" tab, showcases the unique first purchase dates, the number of unique customers who had a purchase during that said date, the percentage of customers who returned within 90 days of the first purchase, and the percentage of customer who returned within the following three months of the first purchase.

I have also included a write up description of what each column will include and the corresponding formulas that I used to achieve the results shown within the report.

Next, you will see that I have created a customized sales report, shown in the "Sales Report" tab, that showcases the growth and key areas to focus on within your organization. As an example, you will see a rapid increase in the quantity sold and overall profit from 2022 to 2023. This is a direct correlation to selling both clothing and accessories within your line of business. 

On the left hand side of your screen you will see some key KPI's and filtering options to choose from. You will also find that in the upper right hand corner, I have included options to clear all filters that you have applied while reviewing this report. Meaning you can go in and play around with a lot of the filters and visuals to find information to help your sales organization take your firm to the next level, and then easily reset your visuals to their starting position with a single click of a button!

Finally, you will see that I have created a customer report, shown in the "Customer Report" tab, that showcases the trends centered around your customer base and to help your firm make informed decisions around who to target next. As an example, you will see that just over 50% of your customers have a commute distance below 5 miles and have an average income of $100,000 or less.

As with the Sales Report, on the left hand side of your screen you will see filtering options to choose from to help review your overall customer base. Feel free to play around with the filters to start finding out some important information on your customers and then simply choose the "Clear Filters" options to reset everything back to its starting position.

The final thing I wanted to speak on is the use of this report on a moving forward basis. While this report is wonderful to review historical information, to stay on top of trends within your organization I would love to schedule time to talk about how we can begin to add on additional data to start to identify patterns within your organization.

Thank you for your time and please let me know if there are any specific questions you have on the report that I can help answer!
